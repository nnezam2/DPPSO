This repository contains the code and experimental results for the paper "Enhancing Batch Diversity in Surrogate Optimization: A Determinantal Point Processes Approach." It provides implementations of the proposed methods, benchmark functions, and evaluation scripts to reproduce the results presented in the paper.

## ** Incomplete version **
We are working on improving the code's readibality and adding more examples
